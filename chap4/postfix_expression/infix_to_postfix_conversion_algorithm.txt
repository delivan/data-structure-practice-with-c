create an empty stack of char;
while there remains a token
    get the next token;
    if the token is an operand
        print the token;
    else if the token is an operator
        while the top in the stack is same or higher priority than the token
            pop the top off the stack and print;
        push the token onto the stack;
pop all off the stack and print;
