create an empty stack of integer;
while there remains a token
    get the next token;
    if the token is an operand
        push the operand on the stack;
    else if the token is an operator
        pop the right operand off the stack;
        pop the left operand off the stack;
        evaluate the operation;
        push the result onto the stack;
pop the stack and return the result;
